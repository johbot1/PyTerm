# PyTerm
One of three Python related projects for my final semester, this terminal based project was fun in that I got to go back to my roots with programming as a whole! I like how basic python is, and banging out a quick terminal function really brings out its strengths as a quick code language to create mockups or test runs of applications before going into more complex languages. Over all, I really enjoyed doing this! The satisfaction of remembering how only a few years ago I struggled to make something like this when now I pump out a similarly structured project in an afternoon really did make this a fun project overall!
